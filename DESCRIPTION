Description: Functions used for graphing in multivariate contexts. These 
    functions are designed to support produce reasonable graphs with minimal 
    input of graphing parameters. The motivation for these functions was to 
    support students learning multivariate concepts and R - there may be 
    other functions and packages better-suited to practical data analysis.
