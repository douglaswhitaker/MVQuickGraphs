# MVQuickGraphs
Functions used for graphing in multivariate contexts. 

## Installation

This version of the package is not yet on CRAN (but an older one is). We aim to submit an updated version to CRAN soon. For now, install the latest version of the package by running this code:

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("douglaswhitaker/MVQuickGraphs")
```

If you do not have the devtools package, install it with `install.packages("devtools")` in the usual way.
